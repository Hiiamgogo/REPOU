//Deploy the ERC20MaliciousDelayed contract to a test Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten, or a local development network).

//Connect to the deployed contract using a web3 provider like MetaMask or ethers.js.

//Call the transfer function of the deployed contract, specifying the recipient address (B) and the amount of tokens to transfer.


// JavaScript code using ethers.js
const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const contractABI = [/* YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI */];
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer);

// Transfer tokens from address A to address B
await contract.transfer(recipientAddress, amount);
After the transfer is completed, check the allowances granted on address (B) to see if the predefined "thief" address (C) has been granted a massive allowance without explicit approval.

// Check allowances granted on address B
const allowance = await contract.allowance(senderAddress, thiefAddress);
console.log(`Allowance granted to thief address: ${allowance}`);
